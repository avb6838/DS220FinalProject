</span><span class="s1">### Analyzing the GDP data of the USA for the past 43 years (till 1980) 
 
Understanding our basic economic standing in the form of gross domestic product is important as it helps us understand how the USA's economy is not only measured, but what weighs into it and by further analyzing the makeup of GDP, we can start to create conclusions about economic growth and increase our understanding of how various monetary vehicles (such as the housing market or the stock market) effect the country as a whole. This is the role of Macro-economists, and by utilizing the data science tools explored in class, we can make their life simpler and display the data in a convenient way that visualizes the necessary data for them to make judgements about the health of the United States economy. 
 
I started the project by going to: https://bea.gov and downloading interactive data 1.1.5 from the Gross Domestic Product tab in tools. From there I edited the data I want to download by changing the range of data from 2020-2023 quarterly to 1980 - 2023 annually. Then I downloaded a csv file that I then had to edit so that the formatting is more pandas friendly by deleting extra lines that were unnecessary. I then started to look at the data through pandas.

</span><span class="s1">It seems that roughly from the 1980 to 2023, households have become richer in comparison to the total GDP of the United States. This means that the total percentage of the gross domestic product being made from household spending has been roughly increasing, from which we can infer that means that households are spending more and by proxy, have more to spend. This metric, shown by the graphs, explains the general state of wealth of the citizens of the United States. The data of personal consumption is also made up of durable goods (houses, factories, and other long term things we buy), Non-durable goods (food, game consoles, and other creature comforts), and services (work from other humans like plumbing or electrical work).

This could be reflective of part of the job market as many jobs in the USA are ones that provide a service of some kind to another person or company.

</span><span class="s1">Surprisingly, even with the new interest in offshoring many modern technology to developing countries, the USA exports a lot more services than it brings in. This could be due to the relative richness of the country compared to other countries alongside the incredible stability of the US economy (evident from the popularity of the US dollar in most country's government vaults).

From it we can still see that there is a very clear difference between the export of USA services versus how many services the USA hires from other countries.

</span><span class="s1">When looking at the visualization, we can draw a simple conclusion that the government tends to spend a pretty consistent amount of the gross domestic product every year. Even with the increasing budget deficit of the USA, the amount we spend out of the GDP tends to hover around 19.3%.

</span><span class="s1">Contrary to popular belief, if we see what percentage of government spending goes toward defense, it is actually going downward instead of the cultural belief of a permanently increasing defense budget. When looking at the data, we can say very clearly that our spending on defense is almost at an all-time low since the 1980s. This means that the percentage we dedicate to national defense is getting smaller every concurrent year with some small exceptions such as the bump after the tragedy of 9/11.

</span><span class="s1">Please look at this data and compare it to your current knowledge of the USA economy. If anything surprised you try to think about and understand why. These graphs are created for the convenience of laymen who usually never approach this data due to its daunting size and I hope that these graphs and insights make it easier for you to understand the greater economic system of gross domestic product.
